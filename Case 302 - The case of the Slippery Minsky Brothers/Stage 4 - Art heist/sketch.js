The case of the slippery Minsky brothers
Stage 4: Gates Memorial Art Museum

Officer: 1820440
CaseNum: 302-3-78449402-1820440

Darn it ! All three Minskys have broken out of the county jail. I told you they were slippery. Word has it that they are planning their biggest heist yet. Tonight they plan to steal multiple priceless artworks from the Gates Memorial Art Museum. Iâ€™ve assembled you a team. Head down to the Museum and stop them.

- Edit the spotlight object by creating x and y properties initialised to your location. Also endX and endY properties initialised to one of the Minsky's location.

- Assign the other 2 spotlights and create the required properties.

- Make the spotlight move perfectly from you towards the Minskys by adjusting the increments of x and y properties.
  If you get everything correct then it will stop over the target.

- Adjust x and y properties using

 * "+=" or "+"
 * "-=" or "-"
